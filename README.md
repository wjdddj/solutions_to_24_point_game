# Find solutions to the 24 point game
## Description
I added two functions that I wrote a few years ago for solving the 24 point problem. I was aiming to find all possible solutions to any given 4 integers draw from a deck of cards.

## Usage
To find all possible solutions for a given 4 numbers, use cal24_simple() function.
Function cal24_for_all() enumerates all possible solutions for all combinations of 4 numbers.
Function to_summary() summarizes a few statistics of the solutions.
